 * The scheduling operations shared code needs, in a shape every Bukkit
 * derivative can satisfy.
 *
 * <p>This abstraction exists because the shared code compiles against the plain
 * {@code spigot-api} and therefore cannot name Paper's {@code AsyncScheduler} or
 * Folia's region and entity schedulers directly. Each platform module supplies
 * an implementation; shared code only ever sees this interface.</p>
 *
 * <p>Folia is the reason the signatures look the way they do. On Folia an entity
 * can be moved to another region thread, or removed entirely, between scheduling
 * work and running it — so {@link #runForEntity} takes a {@code retired} callback
 * that single-threaded platforms simply never invoke. Designing for the strictest
 * platform means the others cost nothing.</p>
