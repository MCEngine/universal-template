/**
 * The single entry point to this project.

 * <p><strong>If you are integrating against this plugin, this is the only file
 * you need to read.</strong> Every platform module — SpigotMC, PaperMC, Folia,
 * the universal engine jar, and the Forge, Fabric, and NeoForge mods — goes
 * through this class, and so should your plugin.</p>
 *
 * <p>It sits at the root of the namespace rather than inside {@code common} on
 * purpose. The implementation classes are one package down and are not part of
 * the supported surface; holding one of them directly is how a consumer ends up
 * coupled to a detail that changes without notice. Nothing here hands one out.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Typical use</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * TemplateProvider provider = TemplateProvider.instance;
 * provider.handle(TemplateRequest.of(playerId, TemplateAction.GREET))
 *         .thenAccept(response -> player.sendMessage(response.message()));
