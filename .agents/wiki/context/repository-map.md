# Repository map

Orientation before touching anything. For what this template *is*, read
[`wiki/information/overview.md`](../../../wiki/information/overview.md) — the facts live
there once, and this page links rather than repeats them.

## What exists right now

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | Entry point: shared set resolution, reading order, trigger table. |
| `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | A single import of `../AGENTS.md`, so Claude Code and every other agent read the same instructions. Never paste content into it. |
| `PROMPT.md` | The one-time fork setup procedure. Deletes itself when it has run. |
| `.agents/index/` | Every index. Six files, flat, named `{scope}-index.md`. |
| `.agents/rules/repository.md` | This repository's own rules hub. |
| `.agents/wiki/context/` | This page. |
| `.agents/memory/` | Task record, decisions, current state. |
| `wiki/` | Human documentation, plus `wiki/logs/` for release history. |
| `README.md`, `LICENSE` | Overview and the MIT license. |
| `settings.gradle` | Project name and the module includes. Modules are added by the task that creates them. |
| `build.gradle` | Root build: derived group, the Java 21 toolchain applied to every module, and the root `clean`. |
| `gradle.properties` | Every renameable identifier and every dependency version. The one file a fork edits. |
| `gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`, `gradle/wrapper/` | The committed wrapper, pinning Gradle 9.5.0. |
| `gradle/gradle-daemon-jvm.properties` | Pins the Gradle **daemon** to Java 21, with per-OS download URLs. Generated, not hand-edited. |
| `api/` | The shared contract. Interfaces, records, enums, one abstract dispatcher. No dependencies. |
| `common/` | The implementation, plus `TemplateProvider` at the namespace root — the only supported way in. |
| `platforms/bukkit/core/` | `AbstractTemplatePlugin`, the scheduler abstraction, the command, the listener, and the one `config.yml`. |
| `platforms/bukkit/{spigotmc,papermc,foliamc}/` | One entry point class each, plus a `plugin.yml`. |
| `platforms/bukkit/engine/` | `TemplateEngine`: the universal jar, shaded, written to the root `build/libs/`. |
| `platforms/mods/core/` | `TemplateChannel` and `TemplatePayloadCodec`. No Minecraft dependency, always in the build. |
| `platforms/mods/{forge,fabric,neoforge}/{client,server}/` | Six loader modules, built only under `-Pmods=true`. |

## What is deliberately absent

Nothing is outstanding. `./gradlew build` builds the shared modules, the whole Bukkit side
and `platforms/mods/core`; `./gradlew -Pmods=true build` adds the six loader modules.

`PROMPT.md` exists here and **is meant to disappear in a fork** — it deletes itself once
setup has run, together with its row in the `AGENTS.md` trigger table. The intended layout, the identity values and the
ordered task list are all recorded in
[`../../memory/tasks/universal-plugin-template.md`](../../memory/tasks/universal-plugin-template.md).
**Do not infer the build from this page** — it is updated by each task as that task makes
something true, so anything absent here is genuinely absent from the repository.

## Where a new file goes

| Kind | Path |
|---|---|
| A rule for this repository | `.agents/{folder}/{file}.md` — and a trigger row in `AGENTS.md` |
| Documentation a person reads | `wiki/{folder}/{file-name}.md` |
| Procedure or framing only an agent needs | `.agents/wiki/{type}/{file-name}.md` |
| Task state, a decision, current state | `.agents/memory/{type}/{file-name}.md` |
| An index | `.agents/index/{scope}-index.md` |

Never an `INDEX.md`. Never a third documentation tree. The authority is
`{shared}/rules/directories.md`.

## Gotchas

* **`.claude/CLAUDE.md` imports `../AGENTS.md`, not `@AGENTS.md`.** The import path resolves
  relative to that file, so `@AGENTS.md` would point at `.claude/AGENTS.md`, which does not
  exist.
* **The trigger table in `AGENTS.md` is mirrored, not authored.** It reproduces
  `{shared}/rules/auto-activation.md` row for row. Repointing a mirrored row at a local file
  is an override and belongs in the root index's override table, never in the table itself.
* **Memory is ungated, instructions are not.** Write `.agents/memory/` freely. Never create
  or edit an instruction file without the user selecting it first.
* **`settings.gradle` tracks the directories that exist.** Each task adds its own `include`
  lines, so every commit has a settings file matching what is on disk. If you add a module,
  add its include in the same commit.
* **The group is derived, never stored.** `build.gradle` builds it from `git-org-name`,
  lowercased. Do not add a `project-group` property alongside it — that is two sources for
  one fact.
* **`namespaceSegment` and `pluginIdValue` live at the top of the root `build.gradle`,
  not in `gradle.properties`.** They name the project in Java source as well as in the
  build, and a rename that has to touch package directories and class names cannot be driven
  from a properties file. Keeping them in one place means the Java tree and the build cannot
  disagree. `PROMPT.md` rewrites them.
* **The version is 0.0.0 permanently.** This is a template; there is nothing here to
  release. A fork sets its own starting version through `PROMPT.md`.
* **Configuration cache is on.** A task that closes over `project` at execution time will
  fail. Capture what you need at configuration time, as the root `clean` does.
* **`api` takes no dependencies, ever.** The moment it depends on Bukkit or a mod loader it
  stops being the thing all four platforms can share.
* **Platform modules never import `...universal.common`.** They go through
  `TemplateProvider`. If the facade does not expose what you need, add a method to it.
* **`AbstractTemplateService.handle` has no `default` branch on purpose.** Adding a
  `TemplateAction` constant is meant to break the build until every platform handles it.
* **A platform entry point declares `createScheduler` and nothing else.** A test in each
  module asserts exactly that. Shared logic goes in `platforms/bukkit/core`.
* **The three platform modules are `compileOnly` on api, common and core, with
  `jar { enabled = false }`.** Only the engine shades them. Changing either would put a
  second copy of every class in the universal jar.
* **`config.yml` exists once**, in `platforms/bukkit/core/src/main/resources/`, and each
  platform module adds that directory as an extra resource source. Do not copy it.
* **The client half of a mod decides nothing.** It sends and renders; the server owns the
  state and takes the player id from the connection, never from the payload. Do not move a
  decision to the client to save a round trip.
* **`TemplateAction` is encoded by name, not ordinal.** Reordering the enum must not change
  the wire format.
* **The payload wrapper is duplicated per loader on purpose** — `CustomPayload` is a
  Minecraft type, and Fabric sees it under Yarn while Forge and NeoForge see it under Mojang
  mappings. Only the wrapper is duplicated; the byte layout lives once in `mods/core`.
* **ModDevGradle needs `maven.neoforged.net/mojang-meta`.** When that host is down, the
  Forge and NeoForge modules cannot configure at all, while Fabric and the Bukkit side are
  unaffected. Check it before assuming a build script is wrong.
* **Use `property = value`, never `property value`, in build scripts.** The space form is
  deprecated and is removed in Gradle 10. The build is checked with `--warning-mode all`.
* **Plugin versions live in `pluginManagement` in `settings.gradle`**, read from
  `gradle.properties`. A module writes `id 'com.gradleup.shadow'` with no version, because
  a `plugins {}` block accepts only constant expressions. The `version` keyword and its
  argument must stay on one line, or Groovy parses `version` as a property read.
* **The Minecraft target cannot move to a 26.x release.** Mojang stopped publishing
  obfuscation mappings with that line, and Yarn has no 26.x builds, so Loom and
  ModDevGradle cannot set up at all. 1.21.11 is the newest release that has mappings.
  Before retargeting, check `downloads.client_mappings` exists in the version's JSON from
  `piston-meta.mojang.com`.
* **Loom needs the Gradle *daemon* JVM to match Minecraft's Java version**, not just the
  toolchain. That is what `gradle/gradle-daemon-jvm.properties` is for. Regenerate it with
  `./gradlew updateDaemonJvm --jvm-version=<n>` rather than editing it.
* **Gradle 9 refuses to configure an included project whose directory does not exist**, so
  an `include` line and the directory it names land in the same commit.
