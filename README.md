# universal-template

A forkable template for a **universal Minecraft plugin**: one repository carrying both a
Bukkit server plugin and standalone mods, over a single shared contract.

## Key features

- One Gradle multi-project build for both halves of a Minecraft project.
- Bukkit side: SpigotMC, PaperMC, and Folia, plus a universal engine jar that detects the
  running server at startup and installs the right scheduler — one file instead of three.
- Mod side: Forge, Fabric, and NeoForge, each producing a client jar and a server jar that
  talk over a plugin message channel.
- A shared `api/` contract and a single `common/` facade class, so a developer integrating
  against this plugin reads one file.
- Renaming is one guided pass: `PROMPT.md` asks what your project is, rewrites the build,
  the sources and the docs, and then deletes itself.

## Quick start

```bash
./gradlew build                 # compile every module and run the tests
./gradlew -Pmods=true build     # the same, including the Forge, Fabric and NeoForge mods
```

Jars land in `build/libs/` at the repository root. You need no local Gradle and no local
JDK 25 — the wrapper is committed and the toolchain is downloaded on first build.

The source modules are still being added task by task; see
`.agents/wiki/context/repository-map.md` for exactly what the repository does and does not
contain right now.

  share one repository, and what a fork changes.

  jars go.
