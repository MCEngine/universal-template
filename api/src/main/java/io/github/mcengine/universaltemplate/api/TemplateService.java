 * scheduler, a listener, or a mod packet handler from growing its own copy of
 * the logic.</p>
 *
 * <p>Asynchronous methods return {@link CompletableFuture} because a real
 * implementation will reach storage or a network, and blocking the server's main
 * thread to wait for either is how a plugin becomes a lag report. The one
 * synchronous method answers from memory and is safe on a hot path.</p>
